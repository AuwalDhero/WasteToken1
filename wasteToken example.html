    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>WasteToken is a platform for waste collection. You can find the nearest waste collection point to you, generate tokens for your waste, redeem your tokens for rewards, and report waste that has been illegally dumped.
        WasteToken is a new cryptocurrency that aims to help us reduce waste and create a more sustainable future. The token is designed to be used to incentivize people to reduce, reuse, and recycle. For example, businesses could offer discounts to customers who pay with WasteToken, or individuals could earn WasteToken for composting their food scraps or recycling their electronics.
